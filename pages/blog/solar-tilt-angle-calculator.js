        <div className="mt-6">
          <p className="text-lg">
            Solar energy is becoming increasingly popular as a renewable energy source. However, the efficiency of solar panels is greatly influenced by their installation, particularly their tilt angle. Understanding how to optimize this angle can significantly increase energy production.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-3xl font-semibold mt-6">Why Tilt Angle Matters</h3>
          <p className="text-lg mt-4">
            The tilt angle of solar panels is crucial because it determines how much sunlight hits the panel throughout the day. The optimal angle is dependent on your geographic location and the season. Adjusting the tilt angle ensures that panels receive the maximum possible sunlight, leading to higher energy output.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-3xl font-semibold mt-6">Seasonal Adjustments</h3>
          <p className="text-lg mt-4">
            In many regions, adjusting the tilt angle of your solar panels seasonally can yield better results. During summer, a lower tilt angle is often more beneficial, while a steeper angle is preferred in winter. This adjustment accounts for the sun's path across the sky during different times of the year.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-3xl font-semibold mt-6">Professional Installation and Maintenance</h3>
          <p className="text-lg mt-4">
            While tools like the Solar Panel Tilt Angle Calculator are incredibly helpful, professional installation and regular maintenance are key to getting the most out of your solar investment. Experts can provide tailored advice and ensure your system is running at peak efficiency.
